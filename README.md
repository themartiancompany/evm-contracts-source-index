# EVM Smart Contracts Source Index

The EVM Smart Contracts Source Index
is a decentralized, undeletable, uncensorable,
network-neutral and network-indipendent Ethereum
Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible networks' smart
contracts' source code index.

It integrates with the
[EVM Wallet](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-wallet)
and leverages the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
to host contracts' source code directly
on-chain.

It is a free (as in freedom) neutral,
network-independent replacement for
centralized, network-specific EIP-3091
networks explorers contracts source code
verification systems, which have become
de facto a bottleneck and a security
vulnerability for EVM networks.

It depends on the
[EVM Contracts Tools](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-contracts-tools)
to interact with EVM networks and it is
written using the
[LibEVM](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/libevm)
and the
[Crash Bash](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/crash-bash)
libraries.

### Usage

To upload the source code the source code for
a contract one can type

```bash
evm-contracts-source-index-publish \
  -v \
  <contract_network> \
  <contract_address> \
  <contract_source> \
  <evm_version> \
  <compiler> \
  <compiler_version>
```

while to retrieve the source code one can
type

```bash
evm-contracts-source-index-get \
  -t \
    <output_type> \
  <contract_network> \
  <contract_address>
```

where `<output_type>` can be one between
`source`, `evm_version`, `compiler`,
`compiler_version`.

For further information and options consult
the manual

```bash
man \
  evm-contracts-source-index-publish
```

or run the commands with the `-h` help option.
