Description
===========

EVM networks contracts' source index publishing tool.
It integrates with EVM Wallet and uses the
Ethereum Virtual Machine File System
(EVMFS) for contracts' source code hosting,
so to guarantee source code persistence,
undeletability and neutrality.

Before uploading, source code is compressed and signed
against deployers or users' EVM GNU Privacy Guard
keys published on the EVM OpenPGP Key Server
so to avoid users from potentially
malevolent RPC endpoints and
man-in-the-middle attacks.
